        <br><h3>About Kaavya Panchal</h3></br>
        <p><br>My Name is Kaavya Jigneshkumar Panchal, a 14 year old Indian and I am the designer of IdealPhysic. I am a student at Greenhills Academy in Kigali, Rwanda. As a high school student, I created this website to provide summarized notes for Physics learners in classes 9 and 10. As a student, I understand how tough it is to revise all notes given by the teacher, and also my peers struggle with the same problem. This can increase the stress of students and can cause poor academic performance. I want to try my best to solve this problem by creating a website that can help high school Physics students in classes 9 and 10 worldwide. Why physics? Many highschool students do not understand the logic behind the physics concepts, so I decided to start with physics to help student progress academically by understanding physics concepts with easier explanations.</p>
